The folder "aaTools" contain tools to make developing with ArchestrA quicker or easier.
Currently 2 tools in the form of Python scripts exist:
    1. aaCreateScript.py    (Creates a ArchestrA script from a file containing field attributes, in this case a script to create relative tag references)
    2. aaCSV.py (Creates a list of values from a csv exported galaxy object by giving the keyword, i.e. if you want to extract all the tagnames or all the PLCPaths or all the ShortDesc's)
    
TODO:
    1. Create a user manual on how to use the tools.
